      The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of global biological diversity based on population trends of
      vertebrate species from around the world. The index represents 31,821 populations of 5,230 species. All indices are
      weighted by species richness, giving species-rich taxonomic groups in terrestrial, marine and freshwater systems more
      weight than groups with fewer species. Using a method developed by ZSL and WWF, these species population trends are
      aggregated to produce indices of the state of biodiversity.


      The index value is measured relative to species' populations in 1970 (i.e. 1970 = 1).


      To calculate an LPI, a generalised additive modelling framework is used to determine the underlying trend in each population
      time-series. Average rates of change are then calculated and aggregated to the species level. For the global LPI, the
      method of aggregation has recently been revised to include a weighting system which gives trends from more species-rich
      systems, realms and groups more weight in the final index.

        description: The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of global biological diversity based on population
          trends of vertebrate species from around the world. The index value is measured relative to species' populations
          in 1970 (i.e. 1970 = 1).

        description_short: The Living Planet Index (LPI) measures the average decline in monitored wildlife populations. The index value measures the change in abundance in 31,821 populations across 5,230 species relative to the year 1970 (i.e. 1970 = 100%).
        description_key:
          - The Living Planet Index summarizes the average change in population size of tens of thousands of studied animal populations. It distills this change into a single number, representing the average change in animal populations since 1970.
          - The Living Planet Index aggregates observations on changes in population size, and similar metrics, across tens of thousands of animal populations.
          - Its 2022 report included figures across 30,000 wildlife populations. This captures everything from frogs to elephant species, rhinos to owls, from every continent on Earth.
